Times series analysis used in justification to increase staff
Time-series analysis of monthly case loads to quantify workload trends and staffing gaps for a social services team. Aggregated multi-year case data, visualized seasonal and trend components, and estimated workload per FTE. Findings were used by management to justify resource needs and directly supported approval for four additional staff members, improving service capacity and reducing case burden per employee.
